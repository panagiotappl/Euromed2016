      <h1><font color="#D9853B">What are the EuroMed Conferences </font></h1>
The European Mediterranean Conference (EuroMed) is a biannual event organised by Digital Heritage Research Lab
 of Cyprus University of Technology and has become a regular worldwide milestone on Cultural Heritage interdisciplinary research.
<br>
<br>

 Joint European and international research produce a scientific background and support for changing our behaviour on Protecting,
 Preserving and Presenting global Cultural Heritage.

 EuroMed Conference enhances this aspect by bringing together hundreds of expertise from academia,
 research and industrial sectors, from more than 60 countries.
 <br>
 <br>
  EuroMed Conference is focused on conservation, massive digitalisation, modelling, archiving,
  visualisation and preservation of Tangible and Intangible Cultural Heritage. The event is also focusing on documentation and modelling of the knowledge (story).


<h1><font color="#D9853B">  Who can participate</font></h1>
  Several Organisations and EU Projects can join EuroMed in order to create an optimal environment for the discussion, explanation of new technologies, exchange of ideas and in general to allow the transfer of knowledge between a maximum number of professionals and participants.
  <br>There are two main thematic fields on EuroMed Conference:
<br><br>  ● Digital Cultural Heritage.
<br>  ● Protection, Restoration and Preservation of Tangible and Intangible Cultural Heritage.
<br><br>  At EuroMed Conference, participants have the opportunity to experience original and innovative presentations, demonstrations, panel discussions, exhibitions and workshops.


<h1><font color="#D9853B"> Issues addressed at EuroMed 2016 </font></h1>

The Preservation and Protection of Cultural Heritage is more crucial than ever before. All over the world Cultural Heritage is endangered, vandalised, destroyed or looted. Through special thematic focused sessions the EuroMed 2016 Conference will address these issues, from the aspect of legislation, through cutting edge technologies, innovation, humanities, ontologies and digitalisation, covering content from archeological sites, artefacts, monuments, libraries, archives, museums, etc.

<h2><font color="#D9853B">The Workshops: </font></h2>


● 2nd International Workshop on ICT for the Preservation and Transmission of Intangible Cultural Heritage.
<br>● 3rd International Workshop on 3D Research Challenges in Cultural Heritage.
<br>● 1st International Workshop on Virtual Reality, Gamification and Cultural Heritage.
 <br>● Information and Communication Technologies for Cultural Heritage Applications

 <h1><font color="#D9853B"> The Digital Heritage Research Lab </font></h1>

 The Digital Heritage Research Lab is underthe Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of the Cyprus University of Technology. The lab was established in 2013 and it is the first, and so far the only one, on the island of Cyprus that specializes in this field.
 <br> <br>Our aim is to explore issues such as digitization, archiving and the promotion of cultural heritage, tangible and intangible remains of our cultural past. Moreover, the lab focuses on how the latest technological developments can deliver this legacy to users. We collaborate on a national level with all relevant private and public sectors. At a European level the lab collaborates with a network of at least 150 leading partners from the academic, research and industrial sectors working towards the development of new tools and applications.
 <br> <br>The research focuses on four thematic areas: recording, access, management and preservation.
 <br> <br>The Laboratory of Digital Cultural Heritage is a prototype of cooperation and has rapidly achieved world-spectrum collaboration research programs and has created a unique and wide research network with great potentials for future activities. The input of the lab is significant, since it promotes and supports an advanced scientific basis.


<h1><font color="#D9853B">Activities and Projects </font></h1>

The lab is responsible for:
<br>● the development of the Cypriot Digital Photo Album “Kypriana”, which will be very soon harvested in the EU digital library Europeana,
<br>● the organization of the biannual international EuroMed conference which is always located in Cyprus,
<br>● editing the International Journal of Heritage in the Digital Era:  www.digital-heritage-journal.eu

<br><br>At the moment the Digital Heritage Research Lab coordinates two major European Research Projects and participates as a partner in five other equally important projects:
<br>● Marie Curie Initial Training Network on Digital Heritage
<br>www.itn-dch.eu
<br>● Virtual Multimodal Museum
